        "dogcart" : "This section points out how much of hypocrite Algernon is by the way of how he calls Jack a “fearful liar.” Even though Algernon is a liar and refuses to tell Cecily the truth of who he really is, in this act Algernon shows how he is a hypocrite by being mad at Jack for lying, even though he lies to Cecily.",
        "truth" : "In this quote Miss Prism tells the truth without hesitation to Lady Bracknell, this shows the honest character of Miss Prism. Miss Prism tells the truth and because she tells the truth she ends up uncovering some of the other lies that the characters have told. This quote shows the theme of deceit vs truthfulness by showing Miss Prism combat the lies that have been spread by speaking with the truth.",
        "algernon" : "This shows that Algernon believes that lying should be everywhere. And Algernon also admits to being a “serious Bunburyist” which is essentially a serious liar, this fits the character of Algernon as he continues to lie and believe that it is ok to lie. So this shows a theme of truthfulness vs deceit by showing the reader how deceit is everywhere and no place is safe from lies.",
        "irony" : "This quote, through the use of dramatic irony, compliments the theme of truth vs deception. In this quote, Lady Bracknell is shocked at the idea that Algernon could be a liar, from this the reader is reminded as to how Algernon is a very deceitful person which contradicts the beliefs of Lady Bracknell.",
        "jack" : "In this quote Jack is seen trying to cover up his lie by telling the truth of how the idea of him having a brother is nonsense. In this quote Jack literally combats his lies by attempting to use the truth, this definitely shows the theme of truth vs deception. Once Jack attempts to cover up his lies he immediately has to go back to the lie that he has a brother once he sees that Algernon is impersonating Jack’s made up brother."
